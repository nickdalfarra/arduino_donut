# arduino_donut
Allows a user to spin a virtual ASCII donut with potentiometers via an Arduino Nano. Based largely on the code from Andy Sloane's blog post (https://www.a1k0n.net/2011/07/20/donut-math.html), with some changes made to adjust for Arduino's limited memory. The framerate is quite poor (1-2 seconds per frame), and I'm considering using quaternions, avoiding floats, or other optimization tricks to improve the performance.

Let me know if you are interested in the circuit schematic.
